# Video-Game-Stat-Tracker
An web application that track a player's stats in the video game 'Apex Legends'. To develop this app, I used React for the front-end and Express/Node.js for the backend.
For the backend, I created an API that recieves GET requests for specified player (ex: /api/v1/profile/:platform/:gamertag). My API then requests a JSON file containing all
player's stats using the Tracker Network API (https://tracker.gg/developers). This JSON response was then parsed and displayed 
on the front-end.
